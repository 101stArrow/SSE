SSE - Superhero Search Engine
===
## About

SSE aka Superhero Search Engine is a Search Engine / Database for Superheroes. This is will be just an idea by a high school students, probably never developed any further. I am just using this to improve my skills, including but not limited to:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Meteor
* Git
* Bash

These are the fundamental parts a web developers skill set which can never stop improving. I would like anyone who would like to give me some help or advice I would love it.

## Behind the Idea

Me and my close group of friends are obsessed about superheroes, fanatically watch the CW's DC superhero TV shows, Arrow, The Flash and Gotham; also watching channel 4's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and last but not least following the blockbuster MCU movies. My favorite being the Iron Man movies

We often have debates about who is best and which would win in a fight and all the other jazz that come with conflicting preference. So I decided to make the one superhero database to rule them all. _(And no, LOTR characters are **not** superheroes)_

## Why did I choose meteor?

Many people may not agree with my choice of using Meteor, but my main problem with all the other options I have tried is trying to tie in the backend. I do not know server side Javascript or any other Server Side language. I was then recommended Meteor, a library which offered everything I needed, secure (almost) database access, bootstrap integration; I don't really like doing masses of CSS) and dynamic elements.

## The future

This project, now after about a month, has reached it's first complete version. I am planning to add many things including:

* Search Functionality
* Ability to edit (if logged in)
* Ability to add if not logged in
* Authorization for heroes not added by member

Optionally;

* Make a hero of the day (Randomly generated)
* Mailing list for hero of the day
* Member list

## Final Thought

Thank you for getting all the way to the end, if you have, (Just imagine me standing up and taking a bow) and I would like to thank those who have helped me make this a reality. (A bow to them too)
